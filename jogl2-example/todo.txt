- on Radeon 2600XT process doesn't exit (perhaps wrong drivers - Catalyst 
  10.11?)
- anomally high refresh rates on Intel GMA 4500 (VSync doesn't work? also 
  should check on other systems)
- on Nvidia ION there is strange tiling effect when vertex comes to window top 
  (cured only with VSync off)
- check again the problem with corruption (using FBO postprocessing): appeared 
  on Intel GMA 4500, multi-monitor configuration, usually on secondary display; 
  fixed by unbinding framebuffer, but it seems normally should not be required 
  action 
- dig more about problems appears after context destruction when shared context 
  is current (workaround works but need to discover)
- implement error handling which doesn't cause process not exit
