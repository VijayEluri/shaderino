- corruption (postprocessing uses FBO) when resized on secondary screen in multi-display configuration (Intel GMA 4500 only?)
- didn't see GLPbuffer RTT work yet
- on Radeon 2600XT process doesn't exit
- dig more about problems appears after context destruction when shared context is current (workaround works but need to discover)
- implement error handling which doesn't cause process not exit
