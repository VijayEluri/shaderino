- on Intel GMA 4500 when used FBO for postprocessors, image not resized sometimes (glViewport?); fix issued, need to be verified
- didn't see GLPbuffer RTT work yet
- on Radeon 2600XT process doesn't exit
- dig more about problems appears after context destruction when shared context is current (workaroubd works but need to discover)
- implement error handling which doesn't cause process not exit
