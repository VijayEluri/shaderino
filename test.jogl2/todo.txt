- on Intel GMA 4500 when used FBO for postprocessors, image not resized sometimes (glViewport?)
- HDR implementation not completed (in ScenePostprocessor when texture created)
- didn't see GLPbuffer RTT work yet
- on Radeon 2600XT process doesn't exit
- implement error handling which doesn't cause process not exit
