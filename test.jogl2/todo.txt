- on Radeon 2600XT process doesn't exit
- didn't see GLPbuffer RTT work yet
- check again the problem with corruption (using FBO postprocessing): appeared on Intel GMA 4500, multi-monitor configuration, usually on secondary display; fixed by unbinding framebuffer, but it seems normally not required action 
- dig more about problems appears after context destruction when shared context is current (workaround works but need to discover)
- implement error handling which doesn't cause process not exit
