- analyze shader compilation warning: 'global type sampler2DRect / global function texture2DRect requires "#extension GL_ARB_texture_rectangle : enable" before use'
- analyze shader compilation warning: 'OpenGL does not allow initialization of uniform variables'
- on Radeon 2600XT process doesn't exit
- didn't see GLPbuffer RTT work yet
- check again the problem with corruption (using FBO postprocessing): appeared on Intel GMA 4500, multi-monitor configuration, usually on secondary display; fixed by unbinding framebuffer, but it seems normally not required action 
- dig more about problems appears after context destruction when shared context is current (workaround works but need to discover)
- implement error handling which doesn't cause process not exit
