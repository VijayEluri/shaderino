- change implementation of effect/shader parameter default initialization: 
  uniform initialization in shader causes Intel GMA 4500 doesn't run 
  application, on Nvidia ION shader compilation warning appears: 'OpenGL does 
  not allow initialization of uniform variables' 
- on Radeon 2600XT process doesn't exit (perhaps wrong drivers - Catalyst 
  10.11?)
- shader compilation warning on Nvidia ION: 'global type sampler2DRect / global 
  function texture2DRect requires "#extension GL_ARB_texture_rectangle : 
  enable" before use'
- on Nvidia ION there is strange tiling effect when vertex comes to window top 
  (cured only with VSync off)
- didn't see GLPbuffer RTT work yet
- check again the problem with corruption (using FBO postprocessing): appeared 
  on Intel GMA 4500, multi-monitor configuration, usually on secondary display; 
  fixed by unbinding framebuffer, but it seems normally should not be required 
  action 
- dig more about problems appears after context destruction when shared context 
  is current (workaround works but need to discover)
- implement error handling which doesn't cause process not exit
